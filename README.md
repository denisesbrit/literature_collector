# literature_collector
Collects metadata of papers from DBLP, Cochrane and/or PubMed according to a 
user-specified search.

This is a result of a small and free project for a course in 2015. 
Not maintained since then. APIs and websites structures might have changed.

Used a few times for semi-automation of actual literature reviews.

Search examples and how to properly write valid query strings are in the 
report document.
